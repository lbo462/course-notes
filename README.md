## Contribute

For simple issues, just tell me what's wrong and I'll correct it asap.

For more complex pull requests, such as course contribution, you're free to open an issue / pull request on github.

**Please, only work on the branches you own.**

If a course is currently being written, you won't find the last version on the `master` branch.
Look out at the existing branches I own and commit your pull request **from** and **to** the correct branch.
